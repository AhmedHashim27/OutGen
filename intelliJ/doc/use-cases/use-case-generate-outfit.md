# Generate Outfit

## 1. Primary Actor and Goals
- **User**: Wants to receive a tailored outfit suggestion based on weather conditions, pattern compatibility, texture, and color matching. The user is provided with a completed outfit, with the option to add accessories for a personalized touch.

## 2. Other Stakeholders and Their Goals
- **System**:
    - Provides outfit suggestions by matching closet items based on weather conditions, texture, pattern, and color compatibility.
    - Supports the option to include an accessory in the final outfit for personalization.

## 3. Preconditions
- The userâ€™s virtual closet is set up with categorized clothing items (e.g., Tops, Bottoms, Shoes, Accessories).
- An internet connection is available to fetch weather data if required.

## 4. Post-conditions
- An outfit is generated and displayed to the user.
- The user can choose to add accessories but cannot save the generated outfit (planned as a future feature).

## 5. Workflow

### Main Success Scenario
1. **Click "Generate Outfit" Button**: The user initiates the outfit generation process by clicking the button.
2. **Retrieve Weather Data**: If needed, the system fetches the current weather data.
3. **Filter and Select Upper Item**: The system filters upper items based on weather and randomly selects one.
4. **Match Lower Item**: The system filters lower items, ensuring at most one pattern is present between the upper and lower items, and then matches by texture and color.
5. **Select Feet Item**: The system filters footwear to match both upper and lower selections and the weather condition.
6. **Optional Accessory**: The user is prompted to add an accessory if desired.
7. **Display Outfit**: The system displays the generated outfit to the user, without saving capabilities.
